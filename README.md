# traversal-visualization
(Work in Progress)
I'm currently developing this tool to be a web app that will be served on GitHub Pages.

Tree Traversal is a common topic used in Intro to Algorithms courses, often to introduce the idea of recursion.
Often, it's hard for students who are fairly new to Computer Science to visualize the effect of all of the repeated and nested calls within
a recursive procedure, so my hope is that this will be helpful to see how Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder tree traversals work!

I'm using the Angular framework to develop this app, in the hopes that it will
* Improve my own Angular skills
* Eventually be hosted online for general usage

Once the project is in a more developed stage, I'll enable forks and pull requests!
